# Prework Study Guide For Fullstack Course

## Description
This github repository is to be used as a study guide for my upcoming bootcamp.
I made this so that I could better understand what it is that I will be doing during the course and would have a base level of understanding for when it begins.
This github repository will help me refer back to what I learned during the prework and will allow me to reference my notes.
I learned about how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to form a website that is easy to use for the end user as well as how to use GitHub to make them.
